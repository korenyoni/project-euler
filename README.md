# project-euler

Solutions to problems from projecteuler.net.

These solutions are generally first attempted with no or very little help from external resources.
If an implementation "just works" but there is a better implementation out there, I generally attempt to redo it,
sometimes with some external help.

Each problem has its own directory.

/lib/ is a directory containing reusable algorithms that I've implemented myself.
